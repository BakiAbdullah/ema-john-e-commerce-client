/* Pagination is a technique used in web development to break up large sets of data into smaller, more manageable chunks that can be displayed on a web page. The logic behind pagination is relatively simple:

*** STEPS ***

* 1. Determine the total number of items: Before you can create a pagination system, you need to know how many items you have in your data set. This can be done by querying a database or an API.

* 2. Decide on the number of items per page: Once you know how many items you have, you need to decide how many items you want to display on each page. This will depend on the amount of content you have and the design of your website.

* 3. Calculate the number of pages: Divide the total number of items by the number of items per page. This will give you the total number of pages needed to display all of the items in your data set.

* 4. Determine the current page: When a user visits your website, you need to determine which page of data they want to see. This can be done by looking at the URL or by using a query parameter.

* 5. Retrieve the correct set of items: Once you know which page the user wants to see, you can retrieve the appropriate set of items from your data set. This can be done using a database query or an API call.

* 6. Display the items on the page: Finally, you can display the items on the page using HTML and CSS. You will need to create a layout that is consistent across all pages and includes navigation links to allow users to move between pages.

By following these steps, you can create a simple pagination system that allows users to browse through large sets of data on your website.
